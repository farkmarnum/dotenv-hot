# Minimal example using JS

## Demo

First, run `yarn build` in the root directory (build the package).

Then, install (in this directory) with `yarn install-dotenv-hot` and watch with `yarn watch-env`.

Then, in another terminal, run `yarn start`.

Modify `.env` (in parent directory) and see the value update live.

Uninstall with `yarn uninstall-dotenv-hot` before trying a different example.
